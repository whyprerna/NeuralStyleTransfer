# Neural Style Transfer

This project focuses on the implementation of a Neural Style Transfer model to generate artistic images by combining the content of one image with the style of another. The project explores different architectural designs of the model, customizes its parameters, and experiments with various artistic styles.

## Streamlit Website

An interactive website has been built using Streamlit to make the neural style transfer process user-friendly. Users can upload a content image and a style image, select from three different deep learning models (VGG19, AlexNet, ResNet50), and generate artistic images.

### Website Features

- Upload a content image and a style image.
- Select the model for style transfer.
- Generate and view artistic images.
- Download the generated images.

### How to Use the Website

1. Navigate to the "Create Your Own Artistic Image" section.
2. Upload a content image and a style image.
3. Select the model you want to use for style transfer.
4. Click on "Generate Style Transfer" to see the output images generated by the selected models.
5. Download the generated images if you like them.

### Limitations

- **Image Size Requirement**: Both content and style images must have the same dimensions for the style transfer to work properly. If the images have different sizes, you may need to resize them before uploading.
- **ResNet50 Model Issue**: The ResNet50 model may sometimes encounter issues due to normalization and matrix multiplication. If you experience problems with this model, you might want to try using VGG19 or AlexNet instead.
